# ðŸŽ› Context Switcher

- Are you tired of doing [deep meaningful work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)?
- Do you wish you could increase your daily stress levels and drastically decrease your productivity?

Then you're in luck!

> Context Switcher: making your work more unproductive than you could ever imagine!

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Microsoft Teams/Slack Integration

Context Switcher has a Microsoft Teams/Slack integration that asks you and your team [all manner of random useless questions](https://www.themuse.com/advice/13-crazy-interview-questions-that-awesome-companies-will-actually-ask-you) at random times in random Microsoft Teams/Slack channels. It's like a fox without a tail chasing it's tail. Pointless questions include:

- Whatâ€™s the size of your shoes?
- Do you believe in Bigfoot?
- Which Disney princess do you find to be the most attractive?
- How would you teach someone to cook an omelet?
- Youâ€™re a new addition to the crayon box, what color would you be and why?
- What do you think of garden gnomes?
- If you were a pizza delivery man, how would you benefit from scissors?

Any many more!

You can even configure your own pointless questions. Never get anything done again!

### ðŸ“£ Foghorn Plugin

Defy boredom with the Context Switcher obnoxious foghorn feature. It blasts truly random never repeating foghorn sounds through your computer speakers at irregular intervals throughout the dayâ€”and night if you configure it.

As a bonus, you can't turn this feature off. If you mute it, it will only get louder. This removes your willpower to work on the days when you are actually wanting to get things done.

### ðŸ˜œ Guaranteed Insanity

After a month of using context switcher, we GUARANTEE you will go insane, quit your job, and be admitted to a mental hospital. Don't believe us? Give it a try. If it doesn't work, too bad. We don't offer refunds.

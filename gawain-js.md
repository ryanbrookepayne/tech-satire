# 💖 GawainJS

The newest and best JavaScript framework of all time...ever.

Bored by the slow pace of Java development? Tired of adhering to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)? Want automatic breaking changes released to your build on a daily basis?

**Then look no further!**

If you thought [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) was great, your dreams are too small. GawainJS is the framework you've been dreaming of.

✊ Even if JavaScript ceases to exist as a language, GawainJS will maintain its place as the best framework throughout history—guaranteed or your money back!

**Note:** GawainJS has no utility at all in the real world. But you should still use it because it's new and super cool and someone at facebook tweeted it.

## Features

### 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities

GawainJS is chock full of potential security vulnerabilities. Once installed, you'll be drowning in GitHub security alerts. We've hand picked only the MOST VULNERABLE dependencies on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). Best of all, these alerts won't go away even if you un-install GawainJS.

### 🚪 Complete Closure

GawainJS makes good use of [JavaScript closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)—data hiding and all! Like Russian Nesting dolls, it gets deeper and more complex as you dig down. This means that using GawainJS in ANY of your software projects GUARANTEES complete emotional, physical, mental, and 🙏 spiritual closure in all areas of your life!

No more emotional strain over the girlfriend you had in college six years ago that you can't get over. No more fighting with your grumpy grandmother. Even family feuds over the distribution of the family fortune get resolved overnight!

### 🎢 Irregular Releases

Updates to GawainJS are irregular and often with no warning or documentation surrounding breaking changes.

No need to install [dependabot](https://dependabot.com/), updates are automatically downloaded and merged into your version control system. And there's no way to turn that off.

### 🤷‍♂️ Random Useless Dependencies

GawainJS is the most dependent framework on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). It autogenerates random dependencies—especially ones you don't need. It'll take you an entire year to read the dependency tree.

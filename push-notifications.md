## Features

### 🚨 Permanent Alerts

Like an annoying child 🧒 competing with you in a staring contest, Push Notifications tirelessly glare back at you from the pixelated safety of a digital monitor. Push Notification are like MacOS alerts...but even better. You can't close them and they never go away!

**Note:** If you do change your mind and want them to go away, you'll have to wipe your hard drive and start over. 😉

### 💁‍♂️ Random Information

Push Notifications will alert you with random information you don't even need. Some of it will be true. Some of it will be false. And all of it will be useless. Enjoy!

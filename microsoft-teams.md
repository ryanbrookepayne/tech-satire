# 🌊 Microsoft Teams

- Do you wish your team would stop communicating with complete thoughts and sentences? 👍
- Trying to encourage a culture of [one-line-at-a-time jousts][1]? 👍
- Hoping to [dissolve and disperse context][2] as soon as it's created? 👍
- Bored with the lack of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) in your life? 👍

Then you've come to the right place!

> Microsoft Teams, the raging river that fills a knowledge ocean.

## Features

### 📁 No Taxonomy

Microsoft Teams ensures that knowledge is NEVER organized. You can't add tags or categories so knowledge remains in its raw disheveled state indefinitely.

### 🔍 Useless Search

Hoping to never find a chat from two weeks ago? Look no further. Teams search is purposefully inept. You'll spend hours digging around for your old communication. And you won't find a thing.

Said something offensive that you wish you could delete? Not to worry, noboby will be able to find it anyway.

### 🏎 Competitive Chatting

Ever wished you could compete for space in a chat channel? You're in luck. Adding comments to chat messages bumps the chats to the bottom. Now you can compete with your coworkers over which chat is most visible.

### 🎛 Built-in Context Switching

Microsoft Teams is engineered to drastically increase your heart rate and blood pressure 💔. You'll feel an unconscious drive to respond right away as soon as you see that bright red number increase on your badge icon. You'll never get meaningful work done again!
